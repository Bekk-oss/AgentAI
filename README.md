## Key Features

- **Role-based agents** with specialized capabilities
- **Autonomous collaboration** between Planner, Executor, and Reviewer
- **Real code execution** with sandboxed testing
- **Structured output generation** for reliable task decomposition
- **Quality assurance** with automated code reviews
- **End-to-end project execution** from task to solution

## How It Works

![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
Planner Agent: Breaks down complex problems into executable subtasks

Executor Agent: Generates and tests Python code for each subtask

Reviewer Agent: Analyzes code quality and identifies critical issues

Orchestrator: Coordinates the workflow and compiles the final output

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Google Gemini API key

Basic Python development environment

Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-collaboration.git
cd multi-agent-collaboration

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Obtain a Google Gemini API key

Set the environment variable in the code.

Usage
Run the system with a project request:
from orchestrator import Orchestrator

system = Orchestrator()
response = system.execute_project("Build a REST API for user management")
print(response)
